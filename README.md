**WEEKLY COURSE OUTLINE: PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS**

**Course Duration:** Monday through Thursday
**Focus:** Practical application of Python programming concepts for data analysis

---

**OVERVIEW**
This week we will explore how Python's fundamental programming constructs are applied in real-world data analysis scenarios. Each day builds upon previous concepts, culminating in the ability to create structured, efficient data analysis systems.
